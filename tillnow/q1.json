I prefer the rougher ones, as smooth means things are slipping all over the place and its can be dangerous.  Plastic will roughen up with use, but cuts and nicks in plastic boards means more places for germs.  For those thin plastic cutting mats, they're so lightweight that you have to worry about both the food sliding, and the mat itself sliding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thickness</strong> : Those 'butcher block' wooden boards look great, but I don't like them for two reasons: I'm short, and it raises the surface that I'm cutting at; they're heavier, and I like being able to pick up my cutting board to take to my stove, as my cutting area is near my sink, not my stove.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size</strong> : Large enough to hold the amount of food you tend to prep at one time, and not so overly large that it's a pain to move / clean / etc.  I like about 18\" x 24\" (45cm x 60cm), but if you're cooking for one in a small apartment, that might be a little large.

To sanitize wood boards, use half a lemon, and coarse salt (I use kosher salt), and use the cut side to scrub the board.  Rinse, let it dry, and give it some food-grade mineral oil every few months, depending on how humid your area is.

It's long enough to cut apples, onions, garlic, herbs, and many prep and one-off items, but also short enough that you can accomplish most paring tasks.  The utility knife size is much more maneuverable than a full chef's knife for simple/one-off tasks, and the length allows for a thin and very sharp blade which you will love.
