",202,"<p>I use two types of cutting boards: wood and [soft] plastic. The plastic is for meat, or anything that could ruin a wood cutting board. Wood is for everything else. If you can afford it, try to get an end-grain wood cutting board.</p>

",685,"<p>Besides the material itself, there are lots of other factors -- </p>

<p><strong>Surface</strong> : There are smooth plastic cutting boards, and there are rougher ones.  I prefer the rougher ones, as smooth means things are slipping all over the place and its can be dangerous.  Plastic will roughen up with use, but cuts and nicks in plastic boards means more places for germs.  For those thin plastic cutting mats, they're so lightweight that you have to worry about both the food sliding, and the mat itself sliding.</p>

<p><strong>Thickness</strong> : Those 'butcher block' wooden boards look great, but I don't like them for two reasons: I'm short, and it raises the surface that I'm cutting at; they're heavier, and I like being able to pick up my cutting board to take to my stove, as my cutting area is near my sink, not my stove.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong> : Large enough to hold the amount of food you tend to prep at one time, and not so overly large that it's a pain to move / clean / etc.  I like about 18"" x 24"" (45cm x 60cm), but if you're cooking for one in a small apartment, that might be a little large.  (although, one of my apartments was small enough that I used a large board, so I could span the sink, as there was all of maybe 30"" (75cm) of counter space.</p>

<p>All this being said -- I use wood for all vegetables, and plastic cutting mats for meats and poultry, just because it saves me time sanitizing everything between cutting.  (although, I typically try to cut all of the vegetables first, then the meat, just to save on cleaning a knife).</p>

<p>Part of the complaint against wood is that it's very hard to get germs out once they get into wood -- but <a href=""http://faculty.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/docliver/Research/cuttingboard.htm"">research has shown</a> that if you clean the surface, wood cutting boards are unlikely to transfer germs to other food, and a well-maintained wooden cutting board will self-heal and continues to be safe over time, whereas plastic can't be simply wiped down once it starts developed scratches from use.  To sanitize wood boards, use half a lemon, and coarse salt (I use kosher salt), and use the cut side to scrub the board.  Rinse, let it dry, and give it some food-grade mineral oil every few months, depending on how humid your area is.  If it's looking sad, you can always sand it down, re-sanitize it and re-oil it.</p>

",15409,"<p>How about something on the edge of the board (like a soft rubber ""fence"" maybe .5"" tall) that keeps the food from falling off.  I realize this is tricky b/c you don't want the ""fence"" to interfere w/ the cutting. But it drives me nuts that food is always falling off the edge (just a tiny amount but enough to make a mess).</p>

",687,"<p>Everyone's stressing the chef's knife, but I'd be even more generic; when starting out, you can do almost every task with:</p>

<ul>
<li>A large knife (8"" Chef, 7"" Japanese Santoku, or a Chinese Cleaver) </li>
<li>A small knife (Paring or similar)</li>
<li>A bread knife (serrated, 10"" or longer)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you add to your collection: </p>

<ul>
<li>A boning / filet knife </li>
<li>Kitchen shears (for snipping herbs without a cutting board or cutting the back out of a chicken)</li>
<li>A carving knife (for slicing meats and large melons or splitting a cake into layers)</li>
<li>A heavy cleaver (so you don't mess up your main-line knives when hacking up bones; heavy enough to use the <em>back</em> of the knife for cracking a coconut)</li>
<li>A utility / tomato knife (mid-sized, serrated)</li>
</ul>

<p>A few people have mentioned a larger chef's knife, but it's going to be harder to control.  Develop good knife skills first, then move to something larger.  </p>

<p>I know a few people who do everything but bread with a paring knife (and no cutting board, in their hand, cutting against their thumb), and I'd consider them ""serious chefs"" (southern, over 60 for the most part, but also a few apartment-living Europeans).</p>

",14648,"<p>Has anybody mentioned a steel? Buy a steel before you buy a good knife. You <b>could</b> buy the best quality knife of the planet but it won't make a lick of difference if you cannot maintain the quality of the edge.</p>

<p>I use a 33cm wooden handle Victorinox chef's knife for most of my work. I steel it several times a day and sharpen it on a wet-dry stone about once a month. Every chef I have worked with who has picked it up has loved it despite being a cheap brand. </p>

",64846,"<h1>A more modern set...</h1>

<p>Disclosure: I'm on the board of directors for a high end knife company.</p>

<p>The traditional advice given to young home cooks has been to get something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>8"" chef's knife</li>
<li>4"" paring knife</li>
<li>Bread knife (performs a common task that the other knives cannot).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, knife materials and home cooking skills have improved quite a bit over the last decade or two so I now advise serious home cooks to use the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>11"" or 12"" chef's knife</strong> - Serious cooks typically know how to handle longer blades, and this gives you more workable edge length for cutting large vegetables and meat blocks, and also allows for fewer and cleaner cuts.  The difference in working edge between an 8"" and a 12"" knife is enormous! </p>

<ul>
<li>Contemporary steel allows knives to be made at these lengths without sacrificing precision or rigidity because the knife spine no longer has to be thicker to accommodate a longer length.</li>
<li>A properly designed, modern 10"" or 12"" knife will have an edge profile which allows for good, western-style push/chop-cutting action with good rebound, but still allow the entire edge length to be used effectively for slicing strokes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>5"" to 6.5"" utility knife</strong> - For most home kitchens, a utility knife in this range is far more useful than a paring knife.  It's long enough to cut apples, onions, garlic, herbs, and many prep and one-off items, but also short enough that you can accomplish most paring tasks.  The utility knife size is much more maneuverable than a full chef's knife for simple/one-off tasks, and the length allows for a thin and very sharp blade which you will love.  For couples cooking together, this also allows for much better knife sharing since the utility knife has far better task range than a paring knife.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bread knife</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The next few knives I'd suggest after the ""modern trio"" are:</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><em>Long sujihiki or slicing knife</em></li>
<li><em>Boning knife</em></li>
</ol>

<p>My strong suggestion for those on a budget is to save money by not buying #4 and #5, buying a relatively cheap bread knife, and redirect the bulk of your budget to #1 and #2.</p>

",64872,"<p>Poll-be-poll, so here goes (vegetarian and not formally trained perspective, too):</p>

<p>Essential:</p>

<p>-One (or a couple of them) that is medium sized (~15cm), thin and can be made really sharp, and has a sharp tipped shape that supports rolling/piercing/slicing (Chef/Gyuto, Kiritsuke, labelled-Santoku-but-actually--more-Kiritsuke-like....). Best if no bolster, having a second piercing/scoring tool available in that spot is useful. Second, stainless one recommended if your primary one isn't. Huge isn't better because then it will be awkward to use for paring too, and will make more of your cutting board space unusable for storage or hand placing.</p>

<p>-One medium to big one that can stand abuse (hacking through an inch of something frozen, dealing with winter squash skin, cutting HOT materials... and damn, the can opener just packed it...) - medium-thick cleaver, inexpensive thick santoku or chef....</p>

<p>-A peeler</p>

<p>Nice-to-have knife block filler:</p>

<p>-Something ceramic for really reactive stuff (salsify, acidic fruit...)</p>

<p>-Selection of utility/paring knives (I don't like much off-board cutting so these get used rarely)</p>

<p>-Something really long</p>

<p>-Nakiri (see motivational clutter :)</p>

<p>-...yeah, bread and tomato knives if you happen to eat lots of these. A Chef knife can cut these things adequately too :)</p>

190,Proper ratio of Water to Rice,"<p>When making rice, what is the proper ratio of water that I should use?</p>
",501,"<p>You're better off going with 1"" above the rice as a guide, if you're boiling long grain white rice, rather than a ratio of liquid to rice.  (except minute rice -- my neighbor once asked me your same question, and I later found out she was cooking minute rice ... oops)</p>

<p>If you're going for paella, where it's a really wide dish, then I go with about 2:1, but some of that liquid might come from tomatoes.</p>

<p>If I'm cooking risotto, I tend to heat up twice the amount of stock as rice, but I might not use it all -- and if I think I might run out, after adding a ladle of stock to the rice, I'll add some water to heat up so it'll get a chance to warm up.  (and it helps to have some extra liquid left over to deal with reheating leftovers)</p>

<p>And mentioning leftovers -- unlike @Dinah, I never cook less than 2c. of rice at a time -- leftovers come in handy for rice salad or nasi goreng (Indonedian-style fried rice), or to package up with whatever the main dish was for lunches the next day.</p>
